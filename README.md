# FCC-Project-Simon Game
Advanced level front end project as part of [FreeCodeCamp][fcc].

**Hosted on Github Pages**  
This app can be accessed through [https://vijayabharathib.github.io/fcc-project-simon-game]("https://vijayabharathib.github.io/fcc-project-simon-game" "Front end Simon Game project on github pages").  

**Challenges**  
*As usual, few additional challenges I set up for myself*
- [x] No js/css library/framework for the game to run. All handcrafted.
- [x] Accessibility through keyboard
- [x] Better separation of concerns (MVC design pattern)
- [x] Some level of TDD (with Jasmine)
